# Encrypted API
Create encrypted API communication between applications in a breeze. Request and response data is transmitted securely using symmetric cipher,
everything is checksummed to prevent modification (MITM attacks) in any way. Replay attacks protection is included in server implementations,
features as IP whitelisting are also supported. HTTPS is not a requirement for the communication channel, but is recommended.
